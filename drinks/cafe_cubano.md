---
- Servings: 6
---
### INGREDIENTS:

- ground espresso (Caf√© Bustelo preferred)
- water
- 1/4 cup sugar
---
### EQUIPMENT NEEDED:

- 6 cup moka pot
---
1. Add water to base of moka pot up to the vent hole. Fill with coffee grounds to the brim (do not pack). Re-assemble moka pot. Add sugar into measuring cup or frothing pitcher and set aside.

2. Place moka pot on stove on medium heat (do not be impatient and set a higher heat. this will ruin flavor). Wait until coffee starts to come out and collect the first 1 or 2 tablespoons of it (this will be the strongest and most viscous part of the coffee). Add to sugar and mix vigorously with whisk or spoon for about a minute until it becomes a light and creamy color (this will form the foam on top of the espresso).

3. Mix remainder of coffee into the sugar mixture. Pour into cups and enjoy
